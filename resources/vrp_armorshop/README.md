This replaces the basic_gunshop from vRP. It's about the same code but modified to accept ARMOR as an "weapon".

Copy your cfg/gunshops.lua to this one or keep mine. Since this replaces the vRP gunshop comment your cfg.gunshops list in vRP.

For example: 

```
cfg.gunshops = {
  --{"melees", 1692.41, 3758.22, 34.7053},
  --{"sidearms", 252.696, -48.2487, 69.941},
  --{"carabines", 844.299, -1033.26, 28.1949},
  --{"rifles", -331.624, 6082.46, 31.4548},
  --{"submachineguns", -664.147, -935.119, 21.8292},
  --{"sidearms", -1305.45056152344,-394.0068359375,36.6957740783691},
  --{"explosives", -1119.48803710938,2697.08666992188,18.5541591644287},
  --{"heavymachineguns", 2569.62, 294.453, 108.735},
  --{"snipers", -3172.60375976563,1085.74816894531,20.8387603759766},
  --{"shotguns", 21.70, -1107.41, 29.79},
  --{"basic", 810.15, -2156.88, 29.61}
}
```
